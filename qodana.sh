#   - test coverage                               (vitest lcov -> --coverage-dir)

# Extra args pass through to `qodana scan`, e.g. ./qodana.sh --baseline qodana.sarif.json

# The backend services keep the token in .env and read it from there. This repo has no
# .env of its own — the committed `env` template declares only the VITE_* endpoints and
# the Sentry DSN — so an already-exported token is accepted first. That also makes the
# script usable from CI, where the token arrives as a masked variable and no file exists.

Qodana 2023.2+ refuses to start without a project token, and the token is what
unlocks the Ultimate tier this scan set depends on (SAST, SCA, license audit).

Create the project on https://qodana.cloud (it is per-repository — the backend
services' tokens belong to their own projects and filing this repo's reports
under one of them would corrupt that project's baseline), then either:

    echo 'QODANA_TOKEN=<token>' >> .env

or export it in the shell that runs the scan.

# vitest still writes coverage/lcov.info before it fails on the threshold.
#
# Unlike the backend services, nothing here needs live infrastructure: the suite runs in
# jsdom with fetch stubbed, so a red run is a real gap and never an unreachable Redis.

# Qodana's IntelliJ JS language service runs as `node --max_old_space_size=1024` inside the scan
# container and aborts (SIGABRT) when it hits that hardcoded 1 GB cap. Where the kernel writes the
# dump is decided by the *host's* /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern: a bare relative pattern like "core"
# (plus core_uses_pid=1 -> "core.<pid>") puts it in the crashing process's cwd, which is the
# bind-mounted project root. On this workstation that reached 12 files and 15.2 GB in
# marketplace-common before anyone noticed, and `prettier --check` then died on them with "Invalid
# string length" — prettier reads a file before deciding it cannot format it.
#
# The host has since been given an absolute core_pattern, which is the real fix, but it is one
# machine-wide setting that no repo controls: a reboot without a persisted sysctl, another
# workstation, or CI brings the exposure straight back. `ulimit -c 0` here would not help either —
# the container inherits RLIMIT_CORE from the docker *daemon*, not from this client shell. So sweep
# after the scan, which is the part this repo does control.
